Git is a VCS-->Version Control System
bug-->unexpected errors
remote-->operating from distance
remote server-->saving project on one server which is far from our system
git-->used to save projects
repository--->folder/package for a project

Git hosting solutions and services===>gitlab,bitbucket,Microsoft azure devops

GitHub is one example of remote repository hosting(to store) service

4 elements of git--->
1.Remote Repository(we will call origin in git)
2.Local repository
3.Staging area--->we can select the file to send yto local repository
4.working directory--->on repository which we are working on it





commands in git:

1.)git init
2.)git status
3.)to send the data from working directory to staging area use "git add file_name" command
3.)to send data from staging area to local repository use "git commit -m "message" " command
4.)to send data from local repository to remote repository use "git push" command
5.)git branch -->tells us that at which branch it is present
6.)git checkout -b "name of the branch"--->we can jump from one branch to another branch
7.)dir will display the directories

master is the default branch in local repository..................but in github origin is default


branches is useful in real time projects when we are working in team ...each member has to create one branch... ..
and when his task completes he can send it to main branch(i.e.,pull request)
"

to bring the project from remote repository to local repository 
1.)fork the project you want 
2.)click on code and select https and copy that link
3.)create new folder in your laptop
4.)go to command prompt of that particular foldder("cmd+enter")
5.)and in command prompt  enter the command(i.e., git clone paste the https link)
